5.7.3 Deliver Final Report Briefing Meeting
5.7.4 Generate Publication-Ready Final Report
1.2 Background
The AHS is designed to provide current information o the size and composition of the housing inventory, the
characteristics of its occupants, changes in the inventory resulting from new construction, indicators of housing
and neighborhood quality, and the characteristics of recent movers.
Housing insecurity is defined as a significant lapse for a given household of one or more elements of secure
housing. The key elements include affordability, stable occupancy, and whether the housing is decent and safe.
“Affordability” implies that shelter costs are manageable over the long term without severely burdening or
compromising other consumption that normally is essential for health and well-being. "Stable occupancy” implies
that the household does not face substantial risk of involuntary displacement for economic or non-economic
reasons. “Decent and safe” implies that a unit has physical attributes that satisfy functional needs for well-being
related to health, security, and support for the activities of daily living. Such attributes include appropriate
facilities for excluding external threats, providing climate control, storing and preparing food, maintaining
physical and mental hygiene, and developing human potential. Not included are aspects of the neighborhood or
environment that one encounters beyond the confines of the structure or property.
Researchers, policymakers, program leaders, and practitioners widely use the concept of housing insecurity, yet it
has not been defined or measured consistently in research literature. The lack of a comprehensive consensus
measure makes it impossible to track prevalence of housing insecurity from year to year and to examine the
correlation of housing insecurity with health, education, employment, and criminal justice outcomes. No
comprehensive transferable instrument currently exists for measuring housing insecurity in national surveys.
In 2017, PD&R at HUD identified the development of a housing insecurity module in the AHS as a research
priority.1 The Housing Insecurity Research Module (HIRM), which was collected as a opt-in follow-on survey to
the 2019 AHS, was developed to provide data on multiple dimensions of housing insecurity that could be used in
the development of housing insecurity indices.2 HUD funded research on the prior Housing Insecurity Research
Support Contract to develop housing insecurity indexes with the 2019 AHS data and to inform decisions on a
reduced set of housing insecurity questions to be asked in the 2023 AHS.
1.3 Constraints
The services identified in this PWS will adhere to the rules, regulations, laws, standards, and conventions
identified by HUD as well as within the Federal Government.

Policy Development and Research (PD&R) 86614624C00004
Editorial Standards: The Contractor shall be responsible for creating publications for HUD and the public in a
clear and accessible manner to both technical and non-technical audiences. Reports shall be stand-alone
documents that provide an overview of the subject, a summary of the research questions, and the data collection
and analysis activities that were undertaken to address the research question or questions covered in each report.
The reports are expected to be of publishable quality, and HUD intends to publish several of these reports on
www.huduser.gov.
The Contractor shall not be required to modify or eliminate independent opinions, judgments, conclusions, or
views. Where the Contractor’s views do not coincide with HUD’s views, the Contractor shall be required to
clearly label such independent views. HUD may require language inserts to label such independent views. If there
is disagreement regarding the adequacy of the data, methodology, calculations, analyses, or other technical
elements of the work used to support the independent views of the Contractor, HUD may require the insertion of a
clearly labeled HUD dissent (or dissents) in the text of the final approved version of a report. Disapproved reports
shall be resubmitted for review following correction of the cited deficiency. The complete text of an approved
report shall be submitted in accordance with the instructions provided in PD&Rs "Guidelines of Preparing a
Report for Publication” that can be found at the following link: https://www.huduser.gov/portal/About/style-
guide-for-reports.pdf.
The Contractor shall use the following disclaimer for each report required in this contract:
“The contents of this report are the views of the Contractor and do not necessarily reflect the views or policies of
the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development or the U.S. Government.”
Contractors are responsible for ensuring that all final written publications submitted to HUD are accessible to
persons with disabilities by ensuring all written materials comply with federal accessibility standards (Section 508
- www.section508.gov). Federal law requires all web-based publications be accessible to people with disabilities,
including those with vision impairments. Before delivering electronic reports, contractors shall ensure that all
elements of the report are Section 508 compliant. 508 compliance requires alternative text (alt text) for all images,
graphs, photos, headers of charts/tables (but not for the data), maps as well as native files for these items. Alt text
can be composed as a separate Word file, but it is preferable and best to include the alt text throughout the report’s
final draft.
In addition to including alt text, contractors shall do the following to ensure 508 compliance:
1. Do not include any merged cells in tables. All tables should have content in each cell.
2. No empty paragraph marks should remain in the document. Use the standard spacing that is applied when
using the correct font styles in Word.
3. Only use colors that pass the color contrast analyzer.
4. Use the font styles correctly in the template. This ensures only one H1 tag is used in the publication title
on the front page.
5. All endnotes converted to footnotes.
6. Enter in the document title in the title field under File > Info > Properties.
Contractors may not publish reports based on these tasks or otherwise disclose the contents of reports prepared
under this contract to the public for 3 months following the formal submission of a report, unless the COR has
provided the Contractor with written permission. After the 3-month period, the Contractor who wishes to publish
shall include a clear notice that the research was performed under a contract with the Office of Policy
Development & Research, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Although these reports will
have been prepared with HUD funds, the Contractor may copyright the layout and design (but not the substantive

materials, and data. Contract records may be maintained as electronically stored information or as tangible
materials. Contract records may exist in either final or any interim version (e.g., drafts that have been circulated for
official purposes and contain unique information, such as notes, edits, comments, or highlighting). Contract records
may be located or stored on the Contractor's premises or at off-site locations.
Electronically stored information (ESI) means any contract records that are stored on, or generated by, an electronic
device, or contained in electronically accessible media, either owned by the Contractor, subcontractor(s), or

(b) If during the period of performance of this contract, HUD becomes, or anticipates becoming, a party to any
litigation concerning matters related to records maintained or generated by the Contractor in the performance of this
contract, the Contracting Officer may provide the Contractor with a written (either hardcopy or email) preservation
hold notice and certification of compliance with the preservation hold notice. Upon receipt of the hold notice, the
Contractor shall immediately take the following actions—
(1) Discontinue any alteration, overwriting, deletion, or destruction of all tangible materials and ESI.
(2) Preserve tangible materials and ESI. The Contractor shall preserve ESI in its “native” form to preserve
metadata (i.e., creation and modification history of a document).
(3) Identify all individuals who possess or may possess tangible materials and ESI related to this matter,
including Contractor employees, subcontractors, and subcontractor employees. The Contractor shall provide the
names of all such individuals via email to the HUD official indicated in the notice.
(4) Document in writing the Contractor's efforts to preserve tangible materials and ESI. It may be useful to
maintain a log documenting preservation efforts.
(5) Complete the certification of compliance with the preservation hold notice upon receipt and return it to the
identified contact person; and

designated by the Contracting Officer with any of the information described in this clause. The Contractor shall
immediately confirm receipt of such request. The Contractor shall describe in detail any records that the Contractor
knows or believes to be unavailable and provide a detailed explanation of why they are unavailable, and if known,
their location.

(2) The Contractor must assert its right to an adjustment under this clause within 30 days from the date of
receipt of the Contracting Officer's request made pursuant to paragraph (b)(6) of this clause. However, if the
Contracting Officer decides that the facts justify it, the Contracting Officer may receive and act upon a request
submitted before final payment of the contract.
(3) Failure to agree to any adjustment shall be a dispute under the “Disputes” clause of this contract. However,
nothing in this clause shall excuse the Contractor from providing the records requested by the Contracting Officer.

clause or the remedial action taken under this clause to correct defective information causes an increase or decrease
in the Contractor's cost of, or the time required for, the performance of any part of the work under this contract, the
Contracting Officer shall consider an equitable adjustment to the contract. The Contractor shall provide to the
Contracting Officer its written statement describing the general nature and amount of the equitable adjustment

SECTION C - PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT Innovation in Affordable Housing Student
Design and Planning Competition
Policy Development and Research (PD&R) 86614624C00005
1.2 Background
The Innovation in Affordable Housing Student Design and Planning Competition (IAH) was created in 2015. The
purpose of the competition was to invite teams of graduate students from multiple disciplines to submit plans in
response to a real-world affordable housing design issue identified by the HUD in coordination with a public
housing authority (PHA), or other agency partners and stakeholders.
Competition Goals:
The goals of the competition were:
1. To encourage research and innovation in affordable housing that improves the quality of life and
strengthens the social and physical fabric of low—and moderate-income communities and neighborhoods.
2. To increase practitioner capacity to produce more livable and sustainable housing for low- and moderate-
income communities through best building design and construction practices.
3. To foster cross-cutting and interdisciplinary teamwork within the design and community development
process.
In previous years, the competition was opened to graduate students who formed teams, that included one faculty
advisor. Each team consisted of three (3) to five (5) graduate students from varied disciplines, such as architecture
or policy and real estate development. There were two phases of the competition.
Phase I:
All teams were required to submit initial proposals, which included up to four (4) pages of narrative and two (2)
design boards that illustrated innovative solutions along the following five policy domains:, covering five critical
policy domains:
1. Planning context and analysis
2. Building solutions and technology
3. Community development solutions
4. Site-specific illustrations of new construction or redevelopment
5. Schedule and finances
Typically, HUD receives around forty (40) applications from student teams representing colleges and universities
from across the country in response to the Departmental invitation.
A jury of housing industry experts then selected four semi-finalist teams that participated in a site visit hosted by
the partnering PHA. During the site visit, the students engaged with PHA staff, local government officials,
developers, and other relevant partners to to learn more about the goals for the site.
Phase II:
The four (4) finalist teams used insights from the site visit to refine their initial proposals. This phase culminated
in the final awards event at HUD Headquarters. The final awards presentations and ceremony occurred during the
second week of April. At this event, finalist teams presented their revised site plans and demonstrated how their
project solutions were innovative and addressed the needs of the community. Following all four team
presentations, the jury deliberated and selected the winning and runner-up teams.
Cash prizes were awarded to all student teams as follows:

The contracting officer will revise this table as funds are allotted to the contract.
(b) For the incrementally funded line item(s) in paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contractor
agrees to perform up to the point at which the total amount payable by the Government,
including reimbursement in the event of termination of those item(s) for the Government's
convenience, approximates the total amount currently allotted to the contract for these contract
line items. The Contractor is not authorized to continue work on the incrementally funded line
item(s) beyond that point. The Government will in no event be obligated to reimburse the
Contractor in excess of the amount allotted to the contract for the incrementally funded line
item(s) regardless of anything to the contrary in the clause entitled
“Termination for Convenience of the Government.” As used in this clause, the total amount
payable by the Government in the event of termination for convenience of applicable line item(s)
includes costs, profit, and estimated termination settlement costs for those line item(s).
(c) Notwithstanding the dates specified in the allotment schedule in paragraph (a) of this clause,
the Contractor will notify the Contracting Officer in writing at least 90 days prior to the date
when, in the Contractor's best judgment, the work will reach the point at which the total amount

payable by the Government, including any cost for termination for convenience, will
approximate 85 percent of the total amount then allotted to the contract for performance of the
applicable line item(s). This notification will state: the estimated date when that point will be
reached; and an estimate of the amount of additional funding, if any, needed to continue
performance of the applicable line items up to the next scheduled date for allotment of funds
identified in paragraph (a) of this clause (or to another mutually agreed-upon date). The
notification will also advise the Contracting Officer of the estimated amount of additional funds
that will be required for the timely performance of the line item(s) funded pursuant to this clause,
for a subsequent period as may be specified in the allotment schedule in paragraph (a) of this
clause or otherwise agreed to by the parties. If after such notification additional funds are not
allotted by the date identified in the Contractor's notification, or by an agreed-upon date, the
Contracting Officer will terminate any line item(s) for which additional funds have not been
allotted, pursuant to the clause of this contract entitled “ Termination for Convenience of the
Government .”
(d) When additional funds are allotted for continued performance of the incrementally funded
line item(s), the parties will agree to the period of contract performance covered by the funds.
The provisions of paragraphs (b) through (d) of this clause will apply in like manner to the
additional allotted funds and agreed-upon date(s), and the contract will be modified accordingly.
(e) If the Contractor incurs additional costs or is delayed in the performance of the work under
this contract solely by reason of the failure of the Government to allot additional funds in
amounts sufficient for timely performance of the incrementally funded line item(s), and then
additional funds are allotted, an equitable adjustment will be made in the line item price(s) or in
the time of delivery, or both. Failure to agree to any such equitable adjustment hereunder shall be
considered a dispute subject to the “Disputes” clause in this contract.
(f) The Government may allot additional funds for the performance of the incrementally funded
line item(s) at any time prior to termination.
(g) The termination provisions of this clause do not limit the rights of the Government under the
clause entitled “Default.” The provisions of this clause are limited to the work and allotment of
funds for the incrementally funded line item(s) and will no longer apply once the contract is fully
funded except with regard to the rights or obligations of the parties concerning equitable
adjustments negotiated under paragraphs (d) and (e) of this clause.
(h) Nothing in this clause affects the right of the Government to terminate this contract pursuant
to the clause of this contract entitled “Termination for Convenience of the Government.”
(i) Nothing in this clause shall be construed as authorization of voluntary services whose
acceptance is otherwise prohibited under 31 U.S.C. 1342.

contractor shall notify the COR immediately whenever any contractor employee no longer has a
need for his/her HUD-issued PIV Card (e.g., the employee terminates employment with the
contractor, the employee's duties no longer require access to HUD systems). The COR will
instruct the contractor as to how to return the PIV Card. Upon expiration of this contract, the
COR will instruct the contractor as to how to return all HUD-issued PIV Cards not previously
returned. Unless otherwise directed by the Contracting Officer, the contractor shall not return
PIV Cards to any person other than the COR.

Contractor in excess of the amount allotted to the contract for the incrementally funded line
item(s) regardless of anything to the contrary in the clause entitled
“Termination for Convenience of the Government.” As used in this clause, the total amount
payable by the Government in the event of termination for convenience of applicable line item(s)
includes costs, profit, and estimated termination settlement costs for those line item(s).
(c) Notwithstanding the dates specified in the allotment schedule in paragraph (a) of this clause,
the Contractor will notify the Contracting Officer in writing at least 90 days prior to the date
when, in the Contractor's best judgment, the work will reach the point at which the total amount
payable by the Government, including any cost for termination for convenience, will
approximate 85 percent of the total amount then allotted to the contract for performance of the
applicable line item(s). This notification will state: the estimated date when that point will be
reached; and an estimate of the amount of additional funding, if any, needed to continue
performance of the applicable line items up to the next scheduled date for allotment of funds
identified in paragraph (a) of this clause (or to another mutually agreed-upon date). The
notification will also advise the Contracting Officer of the estimated amount of additional funds
that will be required for the timely performance of the line item(s) funded pursuant to this clause,
for a subsequent period as may be specified in the allotment schedule in paragraph (a) of this
clause or otherwise agreed to by the parties. If after such notification additional funds are not
allotted by the date identified in the Contractor's notification, or by an agreed-upon date, the
Contracting Officer will terminate any line item(s) for which additional funds have not been
allotted, pursuant to the clause of this contract entitled “ Termination for Convenience of the
Government .”
(d) When additional funds are allotted for continued performance of the incrementally funded
line item(s), the parties will agree to the period of contract performance covered by the funds.
The provisions of paragraphs (b) through (d) of this clause will apply in like manner to the
additional allotted funds and agreed-upon date(s), and the contract will be modified accordingly.
(e) If the Contractor incurs additional costs or is delayed in the performance of the work under
this contract solely by reason of the failure of the Government to allot additional funds in
amounts sufficient for timely performance of the incrementally funded line item(s), and then
additional funds are allotted, an equitable adjustment will be made in the line item price(s) or in
the time of delivery, or both. Failure to agree to any such equitable adjustment hereunder shall be
considered a dispute subject to the “Disputes” clause in this contract.
(f) The Government may allot additional funds for the performance of the incrementally funded
line item(s) at any time prior to termination.
(g) The termination provisions of this clause do not limit the rights of the Government under the
clause entitled “Default.” The provisions of this clause are limited to the work and allotment of
funds for the incrementally funded line item(s) and will no longer apply once the contract is fully
funded except with regard to the rights or obligations of the parties concerning equitable
adjustments negotiated under paragraphs (d) and (e) of this clause.
(h) Nothing in this clause affects the right of the Government to terminate this contract pursuant
to the clause of this contract entitled “Termination for Convenience of the Government.”
(i) Nothing in this clause shall be construed as authorization of voluntary services whose
acceptance is otherwise prohibited under 31 U.S.C. 1342.

“System” means an interconnected set of information resources under the same direct
management control, which shares common functionality. A system normally includes hardware,
software, information, data, applications, communications, and people (see OMB Circular A-
130). System includes any system owned by HUD or owned and operated on HUD's behalf by
another party.
(b) General.
(1) The performance of this contract requires contractor employees to have access to a HUD
system or systems. All such employees who do not already possess a current PIV Card
acceptable to HUD shall be required to provide personal background information, undergo a
background investigation (NACI or other OPM-required or approved investigation), including an
FBI National Criminal History Fingerprint Check, and obtain a PIV Card prior to being permitted
access to any such system in performance of this contract. HUD may accept a PIV Card issued
by another Federal Government agency but shall not be required to do so. No contractor
employee will be permitted access to any HUD system without a PIV Card.
(2) All contractor employees who require access to mission-critical systems or sensitive
information contained within a HUD system or application(s) are required to have a more
extensive background investigation. The investigation shall be commensurate with the risk and
security controls involved in managing, using, or operating the system or applications(s).

(4) The investigation process shall consist of a range of personal background inquiries and
contacts (written and personal) and verification of the information provided on the investigative
forms described in paragraph (d)(1) of this clause.
(5) Upon completion of the investigation process, the COR will notify the contractor if any
contractor employee is determined to be unsuitable to have access to the system(s),
application(s), or information. Such an employee may not be given access to those resources. If
any such employee has already been given access pending the results of the background
investigation, the contractor shall ensure that the employee's access is revoked immediately upon
receipt of the COR's notification.
(6) Failure of the COR to notify the contractor (see subparagraph (d)(1)) of any employee who
should be subject to the requirements of this clause and is known, or should reasonably be
known, by the contractor to be subject to the requirements of this clause, shall not excuse the
contractor from making such employee(s) known to the COR. Any such employee who is
identified and is working under the contract, without having had the appropriate background
investigation or furnished the required forms for the investigation, shall cease to perform such
work immediately and shall not be given access to the system(s)/application(s) described in
paragraph (b) of this clause until the contractor has provided the investigative forms required in
paragraph (d)(1) of this clause for the employee to the COR.
(7) The contractor shall notify the COR in writing whenever a contractor employee for whom a
background investigation package was required and submitted to HUD, or for whom a
background investigation was completed, terminates employment with the contractor or
otherwise is no longer performing work under this contract that requires access to the system(s),
application(s), or information. The contractor shall provide a copy of the written notice to the
Contracting Officer.
(e) PIV Cards.
(1) HUD will issue a PIV Card to each contractor employee who is to be given access to HUD
systems and does not already possess a PIV Card acceptable to HUD (see paragraph (b) of this
clause). HUD will not issue the PIV Card until the contractor employee has successfully cleared
an FBI National Criminal History Fingerprint Check, HUD has initiated the background
investigation for the contractor employee and a Security Approval Notice from HUD PSD via
PSDContractorIn-box@hud.gov has been received. Initiation is defined to mean that all
background information required in paragraph (d)(1) of this clause has been delivered to HUD.
The employee may not be given access prior to those three events. HUD may issue a PIV Card
and grant access pending the completion of the background investigation. HUD will revoke the
PIV Card and the employee's access if the background investigation process (including
adjudication of investigation results) for the employee has not been completed within 6 months
after the issuance of the PIV Card.
(2) PIV Cards shall identify individuals as contractor employees. Contractor employees shall
display their PIV Cards on their persons at all times while working in a HUD facility, and shall
present cards for inspection upon request by HUD officials or HUD security personnel.

contractor shall notify the COR immediately whenever any contractor employee no longer has a
need for his/her HUD-issued PIV Card (e.g., the employee terminates employment with the
contractor, the employee's duties no longer require access to HUD systems). The COR will
instruct the contractor as to how to return the PIV Card. Upon expiration of this contract, the
COR will instruct the contractor as to how to return all HUD-issued PIV Cards not previously
returned. Unless otherwise directed by the Contracting Officer, the contractor shall not return
PIV Cards to any person other than the COR.
(4) The contractor shall submit a report to the Contracting Officer and COR no later than 5
calendar days after the end of each calendar quarter that provides the status of each employee
who is required to work in a HUD facility during the performance of the contract. At a minimum,
the report shall identify the contractor and the contract number, and list for each employee the
following information:

(ii) Name of HUD facility where employee works;
(iii) Date background check submitted;
(iv) Date PIV Card issued;
(v) PIV card number;
(vi) Date employee no longer has need of HUD PIV Card;
(vii) Date CO and COR were notified; and
(viii) Date PIV Card returned to COR.
(f) Control of access. HUD shall have and exercise full and complete control over granting,
denying, withholding, and terminating access of contractor employees to HUD systems. The
COR will notify the contractor immediately when HUD has determined that an employee is
unsuitable or unfit to be permitted access to a HUD system. The contractor shall immediately
notify such employee that he/she no longer has access to any HUD system, physically retrieve
the employee's PIV Card from the employee, and provide a suitable replacement employee in
accordance with the requirements of this clause.
(g) Incident response notification. An incident is defined as an event, either accidental or
deliberate, that results in unauthorized access, loss, disclosure, modification, or destruction of
information technology systems, applications, or data. The contractor shall immediately notify
the COR and the Contracting Officer of any known or suspected incident, or any unauthorized
disclosure of the information contained in the system(s) to which the contractor has access.
(h) Nondisclosure of information.
(1) Neither the contractor nor any of its employees shall divulge or release data or information
developed or obtained during performance of this contract, except to authorized government
personnel with an established need to know, or upon written approval of the Contracting
Officer. Information contained in all source documents and other media provided by HUD is the
